    bio: "As a Full Stack Development intern at Capgemini, I designed and developed high-scale applications using MVC design patterns and perfect layered architecture. I worked part-time at early-stage startups like Basketo and Webox, enhancing my full-stack web development skills. As a Salesforce Developer at Gerent, I developed complex customizations and validations using Lightning web components, APEX, and bulkified code within Governor Limits. I also worked on freelance projects that helped me to gain expertise in end-to-end development.
