        My professional experience includes an internship at Capgemini, where I contributed to developing a healthcare scheduling application. My primary focus was on enhancing the search functionality, as patients were facing difficulties in locating available doctors. To address this, I implemented an autocomplete feature and integrated a full-text search mechanism using Elasticsearch. Another challenge I addresses was lack of communication between doctors and patients. We noticed a trend of missed appointments, which resulted in revenue losses due to refunds and rescheduling. To mitigate this, I developed a reminder and notification system that sends multiple alerts to patients, ensuring they are reminded of their appointments on time. Additionally, during my internship, I was involved in code reviews and played a significant role in writing test classes, significantly improving the test coverage of our applications.
